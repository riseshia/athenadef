### 1.2 Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4", features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
aws-config = { version = "1", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-athena = { version = "1", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-glue = { version = "1", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-s3 = { version = "1", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-sts = { version = "1", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
serde_yaml = "0.9"
anyhow = "1"
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
similar = "2"
console = "0.16"
walkdir = "2"
regex = "1"
uuid = { version = "1", features = ["v4"] }

[dev-dependencies]
mockall = "0.13"
tempfile = "3"
similar-asserts = "1"
tokio-test = "0.4"
```

### 1.3 Basic CLI Structure
- [ ] CLI argument definition (`src/cli.rs`)
- [ ] Basic structure of main.rs
- [ ] Logging configuration implementation

## Phase 2: Core Types and Context (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Type Definitions (`src/types/`)
- [ ] `config.rs`: Configuration file type definitions
- [ ] `table_definition.rs`: Table definition types
- [ ] `diff_result.rs`: Diff result types
- [ ] `query_execution.rs`: Query execution result types

### 2.2 Context Implementation
- [ ] `context.rs`: AthendefContext implementation
- [ ] AWS configuration loading
- [ ] Configuration file parsing

### 2.3 Configuration Loading
- [ ] YAML configuration file loading
- [ ] Default value setting
- [ ] Configuration value validation

## Phase 3: File Operations (Week 3-4)

### 3.1 File System Operations (`src/file_utils.rs`)
- [ ] SQL file exploration
- [ ] Extract database/table names from directory structure
- [ ] File read/write operations (as strings)
- [ ] File path validation

**Note**: No SQL parsing or validation is performed; files are read as strings and delegated to Athena.

## Phase 4: AWS Integration (Week 4-5)

### 4.1 Athena Client (`src/aws/athena.rs`)
- [ ] Query execution
- [ ] Execution result retrieval
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Parallel execution control

### 4.2 Glue Integration (`src/aws/glue.rs`)
- [ ] Get database list
- [ ] Get table definitions
- [ ] Table creation, update, and deletion

### 4.3 S3 Operations (`src/aws/s3.rs`)
- [ ] Query result retrieval
- [ ] Result file cleanup

## Phase 5: Diff Engine (Week 5-6)

### 5.1 Differ Implementation (`src/differ.rs`)
- [ ] Get current state
- [ ] Build expected state
- [ ] Diff calculation algorithm
- [ ] Build diff results

### 5.2 Diff Operations
- [ ] Detect table creation
- [ ] Detect table deletion
- [ ] Detect column changes
- [ ] Detect property changes

## Phase 6: Commands Implementation (Week 6-8)

### 6.1 Plan Command (`src/commands/plan.rs`)
- [ ] Execute diff calculation
- [ ] Display results
- [ ] JSON output functionality
- [ ] Filtering functionality

### 6.2 Apply Command (`src/commands/apply.rs`)
- [ ] Diff calculation and display
- [ ] User confirmation
- [ ] DDL query generation and execution
- [ ] Progress display

### 6.3 Export Command (`src/commands/export.rs`)
- [ ] Get table definitions
- [ ] Generate SQL files
- [ ] Create directory structure

## Phase 7: Testing and Polish (Week 8-10)

### 7.1 Unit Tests
- [ ] Diff calculation tests
- [ ] Configuration loading tests
- [ ] File operation tests (string read/write)
- [ ] Path parsing tests

### 7.2 Integration Tests
- [ ] AWS API integration tests (using Mock)
- [ ] Command execution E2E tests
- [ ] Error case tests

### 7.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Generate API documentation

### 7.4 Error Handling and UX
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Improve progress display
- [ ] Enhance help messages

## Phase 8: Release Preparation (Week 10-12)

### 8.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Parallel processing optimization
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Query execution optimization

### 8.2 Release Infrastructure
- [ ] Build and release with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Binary distribution setup
- [ ] Prepare Homebrew tap

### 8.3 Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Create detailed documentation
- [ ] Enhance usage examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Notes

### Priority
1. **High**: Basic functionality of Plan/Apply commands
2. **Medium**: Export functionality, parallel processing optimization
3. **Low**: Advanced diff display, performance tuning

### Risk Factors
- AWS API limitations and rate limiting
- Athena query execution time and cost
- Performance with large numbers of tables

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests using mocks
- Integration tests in actual AWS environment
- Automated test execution in CI/CD

### Release Plan
- v0.1.0: Basic plan/apply functionality
- v0.2.0: Export functionality and performance improvements
- v1.0.0: Stable release
